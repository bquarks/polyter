# Polyter

An element advanced routing to your polymer apps

## Dependencies

Element dependencies are managed via [Bower](http://bower.io/). You can
install that via:

    npm install -g bower

Then, go ahead and download the element's dependencies:

    bower install


## Playing With Poly-ter

If you wish to work Polyter in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview your element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/poly-ter/`, where `poly-ter` is the name of the directory containing it.


## Testing Your Element

Simply navigate to the `/test` directory of your element to run its tests. If
you are using Polyserve: `http://localhost:8080/components/poly-ter/test/`

## See the demo

Simply navigate to the `/demo` directory of the element to se the demo in action
with Polyserve: `http://localhost:8080/components/poly-ter/demo/`
